# Cyberbullying-Classification
In this project, I have used LSTM architecture to classify whether a tweet is cyberbullying.
This repository also contains the Jupyter notebooks on Exploratory Data Analysis and implementation of Logistic Regression, ANNs, LSTMs on Iris, Breast Cancer Wisconsin and MNIST datasets repectively.
